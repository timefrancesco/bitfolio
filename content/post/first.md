### How is the portfolio chart and value calculated?
It's the value of your assets at any given time.  
If you own 1 bitcoin, it will show the value of it over a specified period of time, starting from the day before the date specified when entering the transaction.

<br>

### The portfolio chart doesn't match the value above
There could be some small differences between the graph and the numeric value above it. 
This is because the total value is calculated every minute with the latest currency valuation, while the chart uses the closing price up to the previous day.

Int64: more than you can imagine.
