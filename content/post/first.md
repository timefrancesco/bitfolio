### How is the portfolio graph and value calculated?
It's the value of your assets at any given time.

### Why should I subscribe?
If you want to be able to add unlimited transactions, sync via iCloud, choose your theme, access currencies not supported by Exchanges and make the developers happy, you will need to subscribe.
